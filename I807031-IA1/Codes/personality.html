    <p>
        “You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest.”

        BTS, namely Kim Namjoon has inspired me since 2017. Their advocacy for self-love and mental
        health helped me through difficult periods and taught me that growth

    <h2>AI Business of 2025</h2>
    <p>
        One impactful AI idea is AI-driven mental health support platforms.
        These systems can provide early intervention, personalized coping tools,
        and accessibility to users globally.This can be good in todays world as it provides a 
        space where mental health resources can be accessed efficiently over the internet. It would benefit 
        persons who are introverted or don't have the means get to a physical session.

        Ethical concerns include privacy and data security. These can be mitigated
        through encryption, transparency, and ethical AI governance.
