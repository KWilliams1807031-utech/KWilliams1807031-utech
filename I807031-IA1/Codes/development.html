    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <p>Chapter 4 focuses on setting clear goals. Writing down goals helps to bring them into reality and makes your mind work towards achieving them. Goals should be broken down into long term, shot term and micro goals. For me, this is something that has helped me organize my life. When i set clear goals with the proper steps i am able to achieve what i set out to do in a timely manner and i know what's next so i never feel lost</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <p>Chapter 6 focuses on surrounding yourself with the best people. Successful people surround themselves with other winners and positive influences and sometimes limiting or ending relationships that hinder growth might be necessary. It's like the saying show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are. I think this is true, I learn more from my friends who share my interest in networking.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <p>Chapter 7 states that knowledge and continuous learning will shape success overtime. Self education drives personal growth, wealth and life improvement. You can't fully grow from schooling, success depends on being a life long learner. For me, technology is always changing so continuous learning is a must because I have to be up to date with the new technology and protocols in my chosen fields.</p>
